Varied the output inpedence to simulate different loads. Monitored the temperature of the controller and mosfet chips with a thermal camera.
## results
Output stable up to 25 watts (which was the limmit of the test system). Temperature of the mosfet rose by 8Â°C. This would suggest stable operation well above the test szenario.
